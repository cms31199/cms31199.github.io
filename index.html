		Throughout the course of American history time and time again have presidents passed bills into law, which are vastly considered un-constitutional. These bills that are passed into law are done so after times of war or desperation due to terrorism or other casualties. The patriot act was a bill passed into law by President George W. Bush directly following the attacks on the two world trade towers in New York City. Bush passed this bill in order to better protect the country from terroristic threats and also to prevent terrorists from deploying another attack.
	The patriot act was a synonym known as the U.S.A P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act which stood for “Uniting and strengthening America by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of 2001. The title of the bill covers a very basic understanding of what exactly this law pertained too. All and all the patriot act gave a vast amount of power to the federal bureau of investigation; allowing them to search telephone records, emails and financial records without a court order. The bill also allowed law enforcement officers to search a home or business without the owner’s consent or knowledge. Congress rushed to pass this bill into law in order to strengthen the defenses against terrorists, but by doing so they also violated the constitution of the U.S.
